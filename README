These are shell scripts to help get CIF data into Bro

You can use create_bro_intel.sh directly on a Bro manager or run it on a webserver and use update_bro_intel.sh on your sensors.

Dependencies : 
  - The Bro plugin for CIF
  - The CIF client
  - An API key for your CIF install (or other appropriate credentials)
  - curl

Files :
  - create_bro_intel.sh
    - Pull current CIF feeds and output in Bro format
  - update_bro_intel.sh
    - grab current Bro formatted CIF data from a web server and overwrite the intel file

To Do :
  * Maybe someday it should transparently support wget / fetch
  * Uh, that's it.
