# detailed install instructions for those who need them

Assumptions:
   1) you have installed the cif client and the Bro output plugin on the host
      where you will be running create_bro_intel.sh.  installation of this is
      out of scope for this document.
   2) you have a valid CIF API key installed in $HOME of the user running this
      script.
   3) you have tested the cif client and bro output plugin.

create_bro_intel.sh
----
1) install create_bro_intel.sh on a web server or on your Bro manager node.
  a) define $FEEDS variable if you prefer different feeds or confidence values.
  b) define $OUTFILE variable to your preferred location.  if you are running 
     this directly on your manager this should be the location you defined in
     $BROPATH/share/bro/site/local.bro.
  c) ensure the user running create_bro_intel.sh has write permissions to the
     value of $OUTFILE and the directory containing it.
2) setup a cron job to run this script.  keep in mind it is poor form to pull the CIF bits more frequently than once per hour.
3) if you are running this on your Bro manager, celebrate.  you're done.

update_bro_intel.sh
----
1) install update_bro_intel.sh on your Bro manager node.
  a) define $WEBPATH to point at the webserver with the generated intel file.
  b) define $INTELFILE .  The default value is most likely fine.
  c) define $DLTOOL and $DLARGS if you are not using curl.
  d) ensure user who runs this script has write permissions to intel.txt.
2) setup a cron job to run this script.
3) start catching bad guys!
